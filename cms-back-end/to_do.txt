done
==========
1- view error messages for invalid fields of category form              
2- add (search - pagging) to categories list..                          
3- set product category to null when category is removed                
4- handle what will be shown when a category is deleted                 
5- add field validation in (FE, BE, DB) for user form

>> add filters (ALL - Active - Inactive) for user list...

>> fix 'email already exist' issue in case of edit mode..

>> visualize user state button pressed activity by changing the button color..

>> add login page for front end

>> add logout [it is done from front end only as i think]

>> add auth Guards for frontend routed urls

>> log any request and response 

========================================================================================
to do
=======

>> prevent lost updates buy using optimistic lock

>> in  integration test the roll back does not occur

>> add generic exception handler for not found entity

>> add error messages for validation..instead of the very long exception message

>> add not found page for non existing urls in front end

>> export inserts from data base tables.. and add them to dml.sql file
>> save user password encrypted in the data base

>> make use of getAuthority overriden method

>> control who can see user password according to their authority 

>> try to make pagging generic by declaring it into one component and pass
the list to it..

1- use pipes to approximate fields in order form to 2 numbers after the
   decimal point
   
2- write a code to initialize data base when project starts..

3- configure app to use logger and to write logs to a file when app is deployed

4- write unit tests..

5- configure spring boot to use diffrent authentication mechanisms for 
example (basic auth  -  jwt auth  - ldap auth)..

8- if there is a page that is the last and there is only one element in it, then after 
deleting that elements ..it stays in the same page ..fix that issue

9- add field validation in (FE, BE, DB) for (category - product - order)..
=========================================================================
order component
================
>> prevent viewing All status in drop down list..
>> change order status field in database to be enum also in front end
>> validate that order deletion is working fine in all corner cases..
>> validation for other order edit form fields in [front - back - data base]
=========================================================================

>> all dates in database should not be a varchar it must be a date so we can order that 
table by date ..if u used varchar u will not be able to 
sort by that field correctly as expected..

>> the password is returned as 60 characters so i trim the spaces in 
backend ...u should save that pass encoded and u should remove the trim from
backend..
